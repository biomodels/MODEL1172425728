# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Simulating Complex Calcium-Calcineurin Signaling Network**   
Jiangjun Cui and Jaap A. Kaandorp _Lecture Notes in Computer Science_ 2008;
Volume 5103/2008;110-119 [doi:10.1007/978-3-540-69389-5_14](http://dx.doi.org/
10.1007/978-3-540-69389-5_14) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Understanding of processes in which calcium signaling is involved is of
fundamental importance in systems biology and has many applications in
medicine. In this paper we have studied the particular case of the complex
calcium-calcineurin-MCIP-NFAT signaling network in cardiac myocytes, the
understanding of which is critical for treatment of pathologic hypertrophy and
heart failure. By including some most recent experimental findings, we
constructed a computational model totally based on biochemical principles. The
model can correctly predict the mutant (MCIP1− / −) behavior under different
stress such as PO (pressure overload) and CaN* (activated calcineurin)
overexpression.
